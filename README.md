# Data Structures & Algorithms Visualizer


## About

Web-application that allows users to interact with various data structures and perform common operations/algorithms on them. 

For example, users can see how insertion & deletion work for arrays and linked lists, can see how various sorting & searching algorithms work, etc.

If possible, users may be able to see more advanced data structures, and their operations, such as binary search trees, graphs, and heaps.

Code documentation and space/time complextiy analysis will be provided in various languages for users to engage with and understand what's going on behind the scenes.

(This is our semester-long group project for COMP363, Design & Analysis of Algorithms)


## Languages/Tools/Services

Currently considering: React, HTML, CSS, JS, Python or Java, Firebase, etc.

More languages, tools, and services will be added as we see fit.
